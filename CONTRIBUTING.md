I'm suprised anyone found this and is possibly interesting in contributing, but if you are, here are some guidelines.

Please fork the repo, make your changes, and make a pull request. I'll review the pull request and merge it with the main repo if appropriate. If isn't merged, I'll provide feedback as to why.

Before submitting a pull request, please be sure that the code you've written is easily legible, well documented, and properly functioning.

Not much more than that at the moment. Thank you!
